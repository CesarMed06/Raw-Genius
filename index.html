      <h1>Naming those who made history</h1>
      <p>
        This website highlights individuals who, for sexist, racist, or homophobic reasons,
        were rendered invisible despite their essential contributions to science and technology.
        Through informative cards, we seek to recognise their work, rescue their stories, and
        give them the place they always deserved.
